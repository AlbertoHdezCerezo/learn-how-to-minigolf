### What we did

Set up the Godot 4.6 project from scratch, configuring it for a 3D mobile game in portrait mode. The project now has the correct display, rendering, input, and physics settings ready for development.

### Why

This is the foundation for everything else — without a properly configured `project.godot`, nothing can be built. The key constraint is that this is a mobile game played in portrait orientation, which affects viewport size, stretch behavior, rendering pipeline, and texture compression choices.

### How we implemented it

We started by researching the right Godot 4 settings for a portrait mobile 3D game. The main decisions were:

- **Viewport: 1080×1920** — Standard 9:16 portrait resolution. We considered 720×1280 (lighter) and 1080×2400 (modern tall phones), but 1080×1920 is the safest baseline that looks sharp on most devices.
- **Stretch mode: `canvas_items` + `keep_width`** — This combination locks the horizontal view and lets taller phones see more vertical space instead of getting black bars. Perfect for a game where courses are viewed from above.
- **Mobile renderer (Vulkan Mobile)** — The full Forward+ renderer is overkill for our minimalistic flat-color art style. Mobile renderer drops expensive features like SDFGI and volumetric fog that we'll never use, while running much better on phone GPUs.
- **ETC2/ASTC texture compression** — Required for Android, works on iOS too. Godot 4.6 combines both into a single toggle.
- **Jolt Physics** — Chosen over Godot's built-in physics engine. Jolt is more accurate for 3D physics simulation, which matters for a game where realistic ball rolling is core to the gameplay feel.
- **Touch emulation from mouse** — Enabled so we can test touch-based drag-and-drop controls using a mouse in the editor, without needing a physical device for every test.

The setup was done manually through the Godot editor UI, following a detailed step-by-step plan. We deliberately skipped creating the folder structure and main scene — those will come with the first gameplay implementation.

We also established the development workflow for the project: a `/research` → `/plan` → `/execute` → `/bitacora` pipeline using Claude Code skills, with git worktrees for branch isolation.

### Key takeaways

- **"New Project" works on non-empty folders** — Godot lets you create a project inside an existing repo directory. It just adds `project.godot` and `.godot/` alongside your files. No need to start from an empty folder.
- **Godot 4.6 merged ETC2 and ASTC compression** into a single setting (`import_etc2_astc`), simplifying mobile texture setup compared to earlier Godot 4.x versions.
- **The plan-as-guide approach works well** — Instead of having Claude generate all files, we wrote a detailed plan with exact UI paths and values, then the developer followed it in Godot. This teaches the engine while getting the job done.
